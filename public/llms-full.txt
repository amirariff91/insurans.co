2. **Third-Party, Fire & Theft (Pihak Ketiga, Kebakaran & Kecurian):** Covers damage to others + fire + theft of your own car. Does NOT cover own accident damage.
3. **Third-Party Only (Pihak Ketiga Sahaja):** Minimum legal requirement. Only covers damage/injury to others. Cheapest but least protection.

#### How Car Insurance Premium is Calculated

- **NCD (No-Claim Discount):** Up to 55% discount for claim-free years
- **Car age and model:** Older cars and certain models may cost more
- **Engine capacity (cc):** Higher cc = higher base premium
- **Driver profile:** Age, location, driving history
- **Coverage add-ons:** Windscreen, flood, special perils, etc.

#### Agreed Value vs Market Value
- **Market Value (Nilai Pasaran):** Payout based on car's market value at time of total loss. Value depreciates over time.

## Guides

### How to Claim Insurance (Cara Buat Claim)
- **URL:** https://insurans.co/guides/how-to-claim/
- **Purpose:** Step-by-step guide for making insurance claims in Malaysia

#### Steps to Claim Car Insurance in Malaysia:
1. **Pastikan keselamatan (Ensure safety):** Move to safe location, check for injuries, call ambulance if needed
2. **Buat laporan polis (Make police report):** Must be made within 24 hours at nearest police station. Bring IC, driving license, and car details.
3. **Hubungi syarikat insurans (Contact your insurer):** Call the claim hotline. They'll assign an adjuster and guide next steps.
4. **Hantar kereta ke bengkel panel (Send car to panel workshop):** Use an authorized panel workshop for cashless repairs. Non-panel = you pay first, claim later.
5. **Isi borang claim (Fill claim form):** Complete the claim form with details of the accident, photos, and police report number.
6. **Tunggu kelulusan (Wait for approval):** Insurer reviews claim. Panel workshop repairs typically start within 1-3 days.
7. **Ambil kereta (Collect car):** Once repairs done, inspect and collect your car.

#### Important Claim Tips:
- Always make a police report within 24 hours
- Take photos/videos at the scene
- Use panel workshops for hassle-free cashless claims
- Keep all receipts and documentation
- Don't admit fault at the scene
- Own damage claim = lose your NCD; third-party claim = NCD preserved

### Insurance vs Takaful (Insurans vs Takaful)
- **URL:** https://insurans.co/guides/insurance-vs-takaful/
- **Purpose:** Explain the key differences between conventional insurance and takaful
- **Key points:**
  - **Concept:** Insurance = risk transfer; Takaful = risk sharing (mutual help/tabarru')
  - **Shariah compliance:** Takaful is fully Shariah-compliant; conventional may invest in non-halal assets
  - **Surplus:** In takaful, surplus is shared with participants; in insurance, profit goes to the company
  - **Pricing:** Generally similar — takaful is NOT significantly more expensive
  - **Coverage:** Same types of coverage available for both
  - **Regulator:** Both regulated by Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM)
  - **Who should choose takaful:** Those who prioritize Shariah compliance in financial products
  - **Bottom line:** For coverage and price, very similar. Choose based on your values.

### NCD Explained (NCD — No-Claim Discount)
- **URL:** https://insurans.co/guides/ncd-explained/
- **Purpose:** Comprehensive guide to Malaysia's No-Claim Discount system

#### NCD Table (Malaysia)
| Years Without Claim | NCD Rate |
|-------------------|----------|
| 0 years (new/just claimed) | 0% |
| 1 year | 25% |
| 2 years | 30% |
| 3 years | 38.33% |
| 4 years | 45% |
| 5+ years | 55% (maximum) |

#### Key NCD Facts:
- **What is NCD?** A discount on your car insurance premium for every year you don't make a claim. Maximum 55% after 5+ claim-free years.
- **NCD reset:** If you make a claim, your NCD resets to 0%. You start building again from scratch.
- **NCD transfer:** NCD belongs to the policyholder, NOT the car. You can transfer it to a new car.
- **NCD protection:** Some insurers offer NCD protection add-on — your NCD won't reset even if you claim (usually limited to 1 claim per year).
- **Third-party claims:** If the OTHER driver was at fault and you claim against THEIR insurance (knock-for-knock), your NCD is still affected. However, you may recover NCD through the Knock-for-Knock Agreement between insurers.
- **Windscreen claims:** Windscreen claims under a separate windscreen cover do NOT affect your NCD.
- **How to check NCD:** Contact your current insurer, check your policy document, or use online insurance quote tools.

#### NCD Example Calculation:
- Base premium for a Myvi: ~RM1,600/year
- With 55% NCD: RM1,600 × (1 - 0.55) = RM720/year
- Savings: RM880/year — that's why NCD matters!

### How to Renew Car Insurance (Cara Renew Insurans Kereta)
- **URL:** https://insurans.co/guides/renew-car-insurance/
- **Purpose:** Guide to renewing car insurance in Malaysia, both online and offline

#### Online Renewal Options:
1. **Insurer website/app:** Most major insurers (Etiqa, Allianz, Zurich, etc.) allow direct online renewal
2. **Aggregator platforms:** Bjak, PolicyStreet, iBanding, Fincrew — compare prices from multiple insurers
3. **Banking apps:** Some banks (Maybank, RHB) offer insurance renewal within their apps

#### Renewal Checklist:
- [ ] Policy expiry date (renew BEFORE it expires to maintain NCD)
- [ ] Current NCD percentage
- [ ] Car grant (geran) details
- [ ] IC/driving license
- [ ] Decide: same insurer or switch?
- [ ] Compare quotes from 2-3 insurers
- [ ] Check if road tax renewal is included

#### Important Renewal Tips:
- **Renew before expiry:** If your policy lapses, you lose your NCD and it's illegal to drive without insurance
- **Can I switch insurers?** Yes! Your NCD follows you, not the insurer. Shop around each year.
- **Road tax + insurance:** Most online platforms offer road tax renewal together with insurance
- **When to renew:** Best to start comparing 2-4 weeks before expiry
- **Documents needed:** IC number, car plate number, current policy details

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Is car insurance mandatory in Malaysia?
**Yes.** Under the Road Transport Act 1987, all motor vehicles in Malaysia must have at minimum third-party insurance coverage. Driving without insurance is illegal and carries penalties including fines up to RM1,000 and/or jail time up to 3 months.

### What's the difference between comprehensive and third-party insurance?
- **Comprehensive:** Covers own damage + third-party damage. Includes accidents, theft, fire, flood. Most Malaysians choose this.
- **Third-Party Only:** Only covers damage/injury you cause to others. Does NOT cover your own car. Cheapest option but risky.
- **Third-Party Fire & Theft:** Middle ground — covers third-party + fire/theft of your own car but NOT own accident damage.

### Can I renew car insurance online?
**Yes.** Most insurers offer online renewal. Popular platforms: insurer websites (Etiqa, Allianz, Zurich), aggregators (Bjak, PolicyStreet), and banking apps. Online renewal is often faster and sometimes cheaper (online discounts).

### What happens to NCD if I make a claim?
Your NCD resets to 0%. For example, if you had 55% NCD (5+ years no claim) and make a claim, it goes back to 0%. You'll need to build it up again year by year. Some insurers offer NCD protection add-ons to prevent this reset.

### What is the difference between insurance and takaful?
**Insurance** operates on risk transfer — you pay premium, insurer bears the risk. **Takaful** operates on risk sharing (tabarru'/mutual help) — participants pool contributions, and surplus is shared back. Takaful is Shariah-compliant. In practice, coverage and pricing are very similar.

### What is agreed value vs market value?
- **Market value:** Insurer pays car's current market value at time of total loss (depreciates yearly)
- **Agreed value:** A fixed payout amount agreed at policy inception. Premium is slightly higher but you know exactly what you'll get. Recommended for newer/premium cars.

### How long do I have to make a police report after an accident?
**24 hours.** You must lodge a police report within 24 hours of an accident, regardless of severity. Failing to report can void your insurance claim.

### Can I transfer my NCD to another car?
**Yes.** NCD belongs to the policyholder, not the vehicle. When you sell/change cars, your NCD transfers to the new vehicle's policy.
